When opened, the user is asked for a city, unless previous has been stored in local storage, when the last enetered city will be processed and all the previous cities.

All of the data is filled in dynamically with DOM manipulation through javascript.

When the page is loaded, the weather parameters are filled in for the page. The latest data is stored in local storage for refilling on refreshing the page.
